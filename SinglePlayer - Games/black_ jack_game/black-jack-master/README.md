# Black Jack Game

The Black Jack Game is a popular card game played between a player and a dealer. The objective of the game is to accumulate a hand of cards with a total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game follows specific rules for card values and player actions.

## Game Features

Card Values: Each card has a specific value in the game. Number cards (2-10) have their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.

Player Actions: The player can perform various actions during their turn, including "Hit" (requesting an additional card), "Stand" (ending their turn and keeping their current hand), and "Double Down" (doubling their initial bet and receiving one more card).

Dealer's Actions: The dealer follows specific rules for their actions. Typically, the dealer must draw additional cards until their hand reaches a value of 17 or higher.

Betting System: The game includes a betting system where the player places bets before each hand. The player can win or lose chips based on the outcome of the hand.

Win/Loss Conditions: The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without exceeding 21. The player loses if their hand value exceeds 21 (bust) or if the dealer's hand value is closer to 21.
