## **Functionality**

-  Marvel Role-Playing Game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Talking about the gameplay, it is a simple game in which the players assume roles of certain characters and attacks turn wise. At first, the player has to select any of the given characters. After selecting a character the player has to fight it against the remaining characters. Each of the characters has different strengths and health. Health is generated randomly to each of the characters, so thereâ€™s no chance of being the same health every time. After all setup, the player can attack their enemies which reduces the health of the enemies as well as the player. As this is a role-playing game, so the player has to wait for the turns to attack.
